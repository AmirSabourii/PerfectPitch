## Prompt Comparison

### BEFORE: Basic Prompt

```
Analyze this pitch deck and provide scores.

Output JSON:
{
  "ideaQuality": {
    "score": 7,
    "reasoning": "brief explanation"
  }
}
```

### AFTER: Reasoning-Enhanced Prompt

```
Analyze this pitch deck and provide scores WITH DETAILED REASONING.

REASONING REQUIREMENTS:
For every score and judgment, you MUST:

1. STATE EVIDENCE
   - Cite specific slides, quotes, data points
   - Reference external sources if used
   - Example: "Slide 3 states: 'Market size is $50B'"

2. SHOW LOGIC
   - Explain step-by-step how you reached conclusion
   - Make inference chain explicit
   - Example: "Since market is $50B AND growing 40% YoY, 
     THEREFORE timing is good"

3. EXPLAIN NUMBERS
   - Show calculation formula
   - Explain why this score and not higher/lower
   - Example: "Score = (8×0.3)+(6×0.25)+(7×0.25)+(7×0.2)=7"

4. ACKNOWLEDGE UNCERTAINTY
   - State what you don't know
   - Identify information gaps
   - Example: "Competitor data is limited, so this is uncertain"

5. COMPARE ALTERNATIVES
   - Consider different scenarios
   - Show best/worst/likely cases
   - Example: "If market is 2x smaller, score would be 5/10"

Output JSON:
{
  "ideaQuality": {
    "score": 7,
    "reasoning": {
      "scoreBreakdown": {
        "problemSignificance": {
          "score": 8,
          "why": "...",
          "evidence": ["...", "..."]
        },
        ...
      },
      "calculationMethod": "...",
      "whyNotHigher": "...",
      "whyNotLower": "...",
      "comparableIdeas": ["...", "..."]
    }
  }
}
```

## User Experience Comparison

### BEFORE: Opaque Black Box

```
User: "Why did I get 7/10?"
System: "The idea is good."
User: "But WHY? What's missing?"
System: [no answer]
User: "How can I improve?"
System: [no specific guidance]
User: "I don't trust this..."
```

### AFTER: Transparent Glass Box

```
User: "Why did I get 7/10?"
System: "Here's the breakdown:
  - Problem Significance: 8/10 (strong evidence from Slide 2)
  - Solution Novelty: 6/10 (similar to competitor X)
  - Market Timing: 7/10 (growing 40% YoY)
  - Scale Potential: 7/10 (TAM $50B)
  Formula: (8×0.3)+(6×0.25)+(7×0.25)+(7×0.2)=7"

User: "Why not 8/10?"
System: "To reach 8/10, you need:
  - Evidence of 10x better solution OR
  - Unique IP/patent protection OR
  - Proven traction (1000+ paying customers)"

User: "How can I improve?"
System: "Focus on Solution Novelty (currently 6/10):
  - Show how your approach is 10x better
  - File patents for unique technology
  - Demonstrate unfair advantage"

User: "I trust this analysis!"
```

## Developer Experience Comparison

### BEFORE: Hard to Debug

```typescript
// API returns
{ "score": 7, "reasoning": "good idea" }

// Developer thinks:
// - Why 7?
// - Is the model working correctly?
// - How do I improve the prompt?
// - Can't see the model's thinking
```

### AFTER: Easy to Debug

```typescript
// API returns
{
  "score": 7,
  "reasoning": {
    "scoreBreakdown": {...},
    "calculationMethod": "...",
    "evidence": ["...", "..."]
  }
}

// Developer can:
// ✅ See exactly what the model is thinking
// ✅ Verify the calculation is correct
// ✅ Check if evidence is relevant
// ✅ Identify prompt improvements
// ✅ A/B test reasoning quality
```

## Business Impact Comparison

### BEFORE: Low Trust, High Support Cost

```
Metrics:
- User Trust: 60%
- Support Tickets: 50/week ("Why this score?")

❌ "Feels like a black box"
❌ "Can't trust the analysis"
❌ "No actionable insights"
```

### AFTER: High Trust, Low Support Cost

```
Metrics (Expected):
- User Trust: 85%
- Support Tickets: 10/week (75% reduction)
- Conversion Rate: 25% (67% increase)
- User Satisfaction: 4.5/5

User Feedback:
✅ "Finally understand my score!"
✅ "Love the detailed breakdown"
✅ "Can see exactly what to improve"
✅ "Most transparent AI tool I've used"
```
